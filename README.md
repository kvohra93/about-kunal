# About-Me Website
My name is **_Kunal Vohra_** and I joined Northwest Missouri State this fall as a graduate student pursuing Applied Computer Science. I am an Avid Gamer and also enjoy playing sports.

This website contains a function to calculate the Body Mass Index of a person given their weight in killograms and their height in meters.

  OR
  * You can also use the terminal on your computer to remotely connect to GitHub and retrieve files from repositories and commit them after            
  * A text editor like Notepad++ or VS Code - Which helps in typing code
  * You will also need an understanding of the following in order to create and stylize your own web page:-

# **_Body Mass Index_**
This value tells us if a person is in what weight category, i.e if they are overweight, underweight, fit or obeese. 

The website validates values of inputs gives by the user using Q unit tests. 

There is a random fact generator added to the calculate page using AJAX

**_Note:_** *The Qunit tests can be loaded from the load test button on the footer found on the Calculate page of the website*
